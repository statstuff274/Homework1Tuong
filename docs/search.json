Both roles use a mix of analytics and statistics in order to work with data in similar but different ways.

As for a data scientists, they: mainly focus on business program and result (i.e. engineering), brings models to data, needs to work with unclean and large amounts of data in various formats, contains both structured and unstructured data, and usually embedded in a production system. There are lots of commonalities between the two roles.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn relationship to these two areas, I find myself to be a mix of both a data scientist and a statistician. My current role as a research assistant uses statistics to better understand certain situations and variables, but I want to learn more about how programming can work with data and statistics to become a better researcher. I’m hoping to learn as much as I can in this course to better understand how to glean insight from data using R."
